        <p>Annual reports are formal financial statements that are published yearly and sent to company stockholders 
        and various other interested parties. The reports assess the year's operations and discuss the companies' 
        view of the upcoming year and the companies' place and prospects. Both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations 
        produce annual reports.</p>
